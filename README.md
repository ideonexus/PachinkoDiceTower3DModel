##Directories##

**stl:** STL exports for the tower.

**stl/parts14x19:** Final, scaled STL files for the model fit to a 14x19 CM glass pane. Also includes gcode files.

##Outstanding Issues##

* Pegs on the left are too close to the side, causing D20 dice to get stuck. Need to either make the interior of the box larger 

* Need to update the front frame for a standard-sized acrylic pane. The current framing is for a pane of glass I had lying around the house.

* The MainBox, top funnel, and bottom shutes fit too-tightly, which doesn't allow for warping in the plastic during printing. Need to allow some leeway.
